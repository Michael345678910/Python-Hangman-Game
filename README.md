# Python-Hangman-Game
This code is a Hangman game implemented using the Python programming language and the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). The code begins by importing the necessary modules and libraries, including string, os, random, and tkinter. It then defines a class called "hangman" which represents the game. Inside the "hangman" class, there are several attributes and methods. The attributes include "played_word" (the word to be guessed), "gameboard" (the current state of the game board), "gameboard_finished" (the final state of the game board), "guess" (the current guess), "guess_archieve" (a list of previous guesses), "lives" (the number of remaining lives), "end_state" (a flag indicating whether the game has ended), and "word_list" (a list of possible words to be guessed). The methods in the "hangman" class include "set_Word" (to randomly select a word from the word list), "set_finished_board" (to set the final state of the game board), "set_create_board" (to create the initial state of the game board), "set_move" (to update the game board with a correct guess), "set_guess" (to handle a player's guess), "get_eg_status" (to check if the game has ended), and "get_user_guess" (to handle a player's input). After defining the "hangman" class, the code creates an instance of the class called "game" and initializes the game by setting the word, creating the game board, and setting the finished board. Next, the code creates the main GUI window using the Tkinter library. It sets the title, size, and other properties of the window. The code then creates labels to display the game board, the guess archive, and the remaining lives. It also defines a button click event handler and creates buttons for each letter of the alphabet. Finally, the code calls the "populate_board" function to create and display the buttons, and starts the main event loop for the GUI window. Overall, this code implements a Hangman game with a graphical user interface using the Tkinter library. Players can guess letters by clicking on buttons, and the game board and remaining lives are displayed on the screen. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.
